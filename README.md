# StuternCapstoneProject

## About
This project is aimed at creating a cheap and simple solution to the menace of diabetes among people especially how it can earlier be detected from series of observations provided by the patient. 

It took in 15 different variables while containing about 520 observations all collected anonimously.

## Models and Accuracy

3 different models were employed. 
1. RandomForestClassifier
2. LogisticsRegression
3. NeuralNetwork
This comparison enabled us determine the best of them all based on different feature engineering that was performed on the dataset. Dataset is a binary classification problem. 

The highest performing model is the Neural Network model using Keras. An accuracy of 99.42 percent was recorded. This was followed by the RandomForestClassifier model with an accuracy of 97% and ROC score of 96%. This is farily acceptable but the NeuralNetwork is most preferrable. This is due to the highest result obtainable and acceptable in the medical sector as errors cannot be entertained.
